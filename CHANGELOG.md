# ants-client CHANGELOG

A record of substantive changes to the reference client. Per the spec
repo's CHANGELOG discipline, this records *what changed*, *what is
now*, and *why* — not just commit summaries.

This CHANGELOG covers **implementation** changes only. **Protocol**
changes (RFC amendments, manifesto edits, governance updates) live in
the spec repo's
[`spec/CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/Ants-Community/ants/blob/main/spec/CHANGELOG.md).

## Unreleased

### foundation/cbor: implement major types 0–3 · 2026-05-20

`ants_cbor` library now implements:

- **Major type 0** — unsigned integer encode/decode with shortest-form
  enforcement (1/2/3/5/9-byte representations chosen by value range).
- **Major type 1** — signed integer encode/decode covering the full
  int64_t range, including the `-1 - n` convention for negatives.
- **Major type 2** — byte string encode/decode with length-prefixed
  shortest-form headers; decoder rejects truncated input as malformed.
- **Major type 3** — UTF-8 text string encode/decode; the codec does
  not validate UTF-8 well-formedness (caller's responsibility).
- **`ants_cbor_dec_peek_type`** for type dispatch.

Canonical-encoding discipline is enforced by `cbor_read_head` (a
static helper inside `cbor.c`):

- Reject non-shortest-form encodings (e.g., `0x18 0x00` is rejected
  because the value 0 must use the 1-byte form `0x00`).
- Reject indefinite-length items (additional info 31).
- Reject reserved additional-info values 28, 29, 30.

Tests cover round-trip for all listed major types, canonical
rejection vectors (non-shortest, indefinite, reserved), and overflow
when decoding a uint into `int64_t`. ~17 test functions in
`test_cbor.c`, single `cbor_basic` ctest target.

Still stubbed: major types 4 (array), 5 (map), 6 (tag), simple
values (bool, null), and `ants_cbor_is_canonical`. Next PR adds
arrays and maps with the canonical-key-order discipline (RFC 8949
§4.2.1 most important rule).

### CI workflow + clang-format · 2026-05-20

GitHub Actions workflow added (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) with build
matrix across Linux GCC/Clang and macOS arm64 Clang, in Debug
(AddressSanitizer + UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer) and Release. A
separate ThreadSanitizer job runs on Ubuntu Clang. A
`clang-format`-check job validates formatting against the new
`.clang-format` config — currently a no-op trivially-passing since no
C source files exist yet, but in place for the first PRs landing
component code.

This is infrastructure-only: no component code, no behavioural
change. Establishes the review surface so subsequent PRs (CBOR
scaffolding, then CBOR implementation) have a working CI signal from
the first line of C.

## v0.0.1 — Scaffolding · 2026-05-20

Initial repository creation. No component code yet.

**Why:** the spec corpus closed both multi-persona review rounds
(see spec repo CHANGELOG Round 1 through Round 5) and the project
pivoted from "design" to "code preparation." The Round 5 decision
fixed the implementation language as **C (C99/C11)** with `ggml`
as the foundation for canonical kernels.

This scaffolding commit establishes:

- The 15-component / 6-layer directory structure per
  IMPLEMENTATION.md.
- CMake superbuild with strict portability discipline (C99 no
  extensions), sanitizers in Debug builds, optional ThreadSanitizer
  via `-DANTS_TSAN=ON`.
- Apache-2.0 OR MIT dual-license.
- Contributing process pointing back to the spec repo's `[CLAIM]
  Component #N` issue flow per IMPLEMENTATION.md §"How to claim a
  sub-component".
- One `README.md` per component subdirectory with spec reference,
  claim status (currently all "pending claim"), and intended
  interface.

No protocol behaviour is defined here. The bytes on the wire remain
specified by the spec repo's RFCs; this client will implement them
as components are claimed and code lands.
