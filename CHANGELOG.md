# ants-client CHANGELOG

A record of substantive changes to the reference client. Per the spec
repo's CHANGELOG discipline, this records *what changed*, *what is
now*, and *why* — not just commit summaries.

This CHANGELOG covers **implementation** changes only. **Protocol**
changes (RFC amendments, manifesto edits, governance updates) live in
the spec repo's
[`spec/CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/Ants-Community/ants/blob/main/spec/CHANGELOG.md).

## v0.0.1 — Scaffolding · 2026-05-20

Initial repository creation. No component code yet.

**Why:** the spec corpus closed both multi-persona review rounds
(see spec repo CHANGELOG Round 1 through Round 5) and the project
pivoted from "design" to "code preparation." The Round 5 decision
fixed the implementation language as **C (C99/C11)** with `ggml`
as the foundation for canonical kernels.

This scaffolding commit establishes:

- The 15-component / 6-layer directory structure per
  IMPLEMENTATION.md.
- CMake superbuild with strict portability discipline (C99 no
  extensions), sanitizers in Debug builds, optional ThreadSanitizer
  via `-DANTS_TSAN=ON`.
- Apache-2.0 OR MIT dual-license.
- Contributing process pointing back to the spec repo's `[CLAIM]
  Component #N` issue flow per IMPLEMENTATION.md §"How to claim a
  sub-component".
- One `README.md` per component subdirectory with spec reference,
  claim status (currently all "pending claim"), and intended
  interface.

No protocol behaviour is defined here. The bytes on the wire remain
specified by the spec repo's RFCs; this client will implement them
as components are claimed and code lands.
